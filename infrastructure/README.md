# Deployment
We use Terraform to deploy all infrastructure and ansible to configure remote edge nodes to install agent software.

## Components

The project spins up an infrastructure stack on Google Cloud Platform which consists of:
- vpc 
- subnets & firewall
- gke

Optionally, there is a choice to deploy x86 or arm nodes on Packet.

After the infrastructure setup, iofog ECN is deployed on the GKE cluster using the iofog Helm chart.

Once the control plane is setup, ansible is used to configure edge nodes provided by user as an inventory in the hosts.ini file, and any packet nodes cretaed. Iofog agent software id deployed on these, configured and registerd with the iofog controller in the control plane.

## Prerequisites

Install tools:
- Terraform (v11*)
- Ansible
- gcloud
- Helm
- Kubectl

Account tokens:
- packet account token exported as an environment variable for packet provider. Command: `export PACKET_AUTH_TOKEN=xxxxx`
- package_cloud account token exported as a terraforn environment variable. Command: `export PACKAGE_CLOUD_CREDS=xxxxx`
- gcloud account token to deploy to GCP

## Usage

As a user, you can switch to the environments_gke directory to find a user folder holding a sample user environment inventory and environment configuration. This configuration does not have a terraform backend, will use local backend to store terraform state files.

In the user directory, run:

1. *terraform init* to initialize your terraform directory
2. *terraform plan -var-file="vars.tfvars"* pass in your vars file
3. *terraform apply -var-file="vars.tfvars" -auto-approve* apply will create your resources
4. *terraform destroy -var-file="vars.tfvars" -auto-approve* use the destroy command to delete all your resources

## Ansible Playbook for Agent Configuration

We use ansible to configure edge nodes with Agent software. You can provide an inventory with the remote hosts details to provision agents. See sample inventory `edge_hosts.ini`. 

See sample command Terraform used to run the playbook to provision agents. From the user environment folder, run the following command. This uses the `agent.yml` playbook under the ansible folder. 

```
ansible-playbook ../../agent.yml --private-key=<<PATH_TO_SSH_KEY>> -e \"controller_ip=<<CONTROLLER_IP>> agent_repo=<<AGENT_REPO>> agent_version=<<AGENT_VERSION>> package_cloud_creds=<<PACKAGE_CLOUD_CREDS>>\" -i edge_hosts.ini
```

If you plan to use snapshot repo, you will need to provide package cloud token, leave it empty if installing released version. 

### Helpful Commands

- Login to gcloud: `gcloud auth login`

- Kubeconfig for gke cluster: `gcloud container clusters get-credentials <<CLUSTER_NAME>> --region <<REGION>>`

- Delete a particular terraform resource: `terraform destroy -target=null_resource.iofog -var-file=vars.tfvars -auto-approve`

- Terraform OUtput `terraform output -module=packet_edge_nodes`
